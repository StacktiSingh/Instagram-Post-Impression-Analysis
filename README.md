## Overview
This project analyzes Instagram post performance using real engagement data to understand **what drives reach and follower growth**.  
Using exploratory data analysis, small-data machine learning, and interpretable metrics, the project provides actionable insights for content strategy rather than chasing artificial accuracy.

A simple Linear Regression model is used **for interpretability**, not blind prediction, and the insights are later showcased through a Flask web application.
